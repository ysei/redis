Known issues
------------

Currently, the label file parsing seems somewhat borked. 

This is particularly the case for the more complex data structures, but on certain occasions just adding a comment label might lead to neverending output loops.


Vaguely planned, but don't hold your breath
-------------------------------------------

- achieve full compatibility with "The Macro Assembler AS" by Alfred Arnold (http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/)
- support for 6502 (as there seems to be no proper 6502 disassembler out there anymore)
- auto-assembly starting with the various CPU vectors to automatically determine code and data segments
- call-tree generation
